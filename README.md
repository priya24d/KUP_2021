What Scala? Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for both object-oriented programming and functional programming. The language has a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java./n

In this Repository /n
I have created SBT, Maven, Reverse, Selection sorting and Collection including table, lastelement, Stack and Queue Assignments and OOPS assignments./n

<H3>1. SBT Assignment-</H3>/n
A class named Calculator using scala which contains the implementation of the following operations:/n
<ul>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction</li>
<li>Multiplication</li>
<li>Division</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Absolute</li>
<li>Modulue</li>
<li>Maximum of Two</li>
<li>Minimum of Two</li>
/n
A test file with test cases of all the operations.
With following commands:-
sbt compile - To compile the code
sbt test - To execute unit test cases
sbt scalastyleGenerateConfig - To generate scalastyle config file
sbt scalastyle - To execute scalastyle plugin for API
sbt test:scalastyle - To execute scalastyle plugin for test cases

<H3>2. Maven Assignment-</H3>\n
A class named Calculator using scala which contains the implementation of the following operations:\n
<ul>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction</li>
<li>Multiplication</li>
<li>Division</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Absolute</li>
<li>Modulus</li>
<li>Maximum of Two</li>
<li>Minimum of Two</li>
</ul>
/n
A test file with test cases of all the operations.
With following commands:-
mvn compile - To compile the code
mvn package - To generate package
mvn test - To execute unit test cases
mvn scalastyle:check - To execute scalastyle plugin for API and test cases

<H3>3. Reverse Assignment-</H3>
I have created a Reverse class which reverses the list without mutable variable i.e Immutable variable./n

Immutable Variable: These variables are those variables which do not allow you to change a value after the declaration of a variable. Immutable variables are defined by using the val keyword.The first letter of data type should be in capital letter because in the Scala data type is treated as objects. For example- val Variable_name: Data_type = "value";/n

Reverse: In Scala Stack class , the reverse() method is utilized to return a stack with the reverse order. Return Type: It returns a stack with the reverse order.

<H3>4. Sorting Assignment-</H3>
I have created a Sorting class which reverses the list without mutable variable i.e Immutable variable.

<H3>5. Collection Assignment-</H3>\n
This Assignment consist of the following three questions:\n
<ul>
<li>Find the last element of list with its index value(dont use inbuilt methods to extract last element directly)</li>
<li>Print the table of each element in the List</li>
<li>Implement Stack and Queue using Lists.</li>
  </ul>


<H3>5. OOPS Assignment-</H3>
<ul> 
  <li> Performing queue </li>
  <li> Comparison </li>
  </ul>
